# Standards Index

## How to Use This Index

This file is the entry point for all shared standards in the agent-system. When you need to apply standards:

1. Identify the relevant standards category below
2. Navigate to the specified path
3. For folder-based standards, read the category files applicable to your task
4. Load all relevant standards before performing work

---

## Languages

Programming language standards for consistent development practices.

**Path:** `standards/languages/`

**Structure:** Each language has a subfolder containing standardised category files.

### Categories

| Category | Filename | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Core | `core.md` | Overview, principles, project structure, naming, coding style |
| Tooling | `tooling.md` | Package manager, linter, formatter, LSP, type checker, test framework |
| Security | `security.md` | Prohibited practices, secure practices, language-specific risks |
| Development Environment | `development-environment.md` | DevContainer features, VS Code extensions, settings, tool coexistence |

### Supported Languages

| Language | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Python | `standards/languages/python/` | Modern Python with uv, Ruff, and strict typing |
| TypeScript | `standards/languages/typescript/` | Type-safe JavaScript with ESLint, Prettier, and pnpm |
| Bash | `standards/languages/bash/` | Portable shell scripting with ShellCheck and shfmt |

### Loading Language Standards

When working with a specific language:

1. Read `standards/languages/<language>/core.md` for foundational requirements
2. Load additional category files based on the task:
   - Creating a DevContainer? Load `development-environment.md`
   - Setting up tooling? Load `tooling.md`
   - Reviewing code? Load `security.md`

## Git Workflow

Customizable policies for git-based development workflows including branch naming, commits, and pull requests.

**Path:** `standards/git-workflow/`

**Structure:** Policy files that can be customised by organisations to match their specific requirements.

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `branch.md` | Branch naming patterns, allowed types, validation regex |
| `commit.md` | Commit types, scopes, AI trailer configuration |
| `commit.template.md` | Commit message templates with examples |
| `pull-request.md` | PR title format, description structure, review requirements |
| `pull-request.template.md` | PR description template |

### Usage

These standards are loaded by the `git-workflow` skill alongside its bundled invariant rules:

1. **Invariant rules** in `skills/git-workflow/standards/` define the *process* (cannot be overridden)
2. **Customizable policies** in `standards/git-workflow/` define *organisation-specific values* (can be modified)

To customise git workflow behaviour for your project, modify the files in `standards/git-workflow/`.

## Note on Skill-Bundled Standards

Some domain-specific standards are bundled with their skills rather than in this shared standards folder. Skills that bundle their own standards include:

- **DevContainer** — `skills/devcontainer/standards/`
- **Decision Records** — `skills/decision-records/standards/`
- **Git Workflow** — `skills/git-workflow/standards/` (invariant rules; customizable policies are in `standards/git-workflow/`)

When working in these domains, load standards from the skill's `standards/` folder instead of looking here.
