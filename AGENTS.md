# AI Agent System Repository

## Purpose

This repository develops the **agent-system** bundle — a portable collection of agents, skills, and standards that enables AI-assisted engineering in any repository.

## AI-Assisted Development

This repository uses its own agent-system to build and improve itself. AI agents working in this repository should load the agent-system instructions:

**→ See [`agent-system/AGENTS.md`](agent-system/AGENTS.md) for agent routing, skills, and standards.**
